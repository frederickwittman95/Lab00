<h1>Lab 00:  Hello GitHub</h1>

<p>Due February 4th at the end of your Lab session</p>

<p>By the end of this lab, you will have a code repository on
github that contains the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>README.md</tt></li>
<li><tt>HelloGithub.cpp</tt></li>
<li><tt>HelloGithub.py</tt></li>
<li><tt>&lt;yourname&gt;_HelpSheet.txt</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>During the course of this lab you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone a repository</li>

<li>Create a branch</li>

<li>Create a file within a branch</li>

<li>Commit a branch</li>

<li>Create and accept a pull request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started with Github</h2>

<p>We will use the website github.com to complete this lab, but you could use the command line interface (CLI) or
desktop program (desktop.github.com), if you prefer.  Although the GIT software system is primarily for source code version control, we are using GitHub for distributing program files through repositories.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Go to <a
href="http://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank"><span
style='color:#008EE2'>http://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/</a>&nbsp; and
read through the entire page. This is quite similar to what you must do for
this lab so follow along closely, although you will not be creating a new repository but rather forking and cloning a class reporitory.</p>

<p>If you do not yet have a Github account then this is the
time to create one.</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to <a
href="http://classroom.github.com/" target="_blank">http://classroom.github.com</a>&nbsp;using
your github user account</li>
<li>Go to the following page to link to our classroom
account:&nbsp;<a
href="https://classroom.github.com/a/awdbIYCE" target="_blank">https://classroom.github.com/a/awdbIYCE</a></li>
<li>Find your email address within the list of available
accounts.  If yours does not show up, let your instructor and lab assistant know right away.</li>
<li>On click of "Accept this assignment," the <tt>lab00-assignment-&lt;your-name&rt;</tt> repository will be available in your
GitHub account.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the Lab00 to a local system, wherever you want to work, such as a student lab computer or your own home computer.</li>
<li>Create a new branch in your Lab00 repository.  You could call it "branch-00" or something like that.  (Remember, if you make a mistake, you can branch again from "master.")</li>

<li>Click on the edit (pencil) icon for the README.md file and add a sentence describing your previous experience with C++ and Python, signing with your name.  (Scroll down to commit changes.)</li>

<li>Run both "Hello Github" programs, one in C++ and one in Python.  You will probably need to consult other sources to find out how to do that.  Make sure that the input file is in the correct folder.  Check that the output file is produced correctly.</li>

<li>Add comments to the source code for each program, one comment or more per line of code, explaining what the code does.  Run the programs again to make sure they still work.  Add your modified source code files to your repository, using the Upload Files button, and don't forget to commit changes.</li>

<li>Back in your new branch on GitHub.com, create a new text file called <tt>&lt;yourname&gt;_HelpSheet.txt</tt> that notes these helpful pieces of information:</li>
<ul>
<li>How to comment C++ code
<li>How to comment Python code
<li>What kind of file has extension ".md"
</ul>
<li>You will add to this file throughout the semester. Use the Upload Files button to add to your new branch.</li>

<li>Commit and push this branch to your repository.  Note the "diffs" (difference in original and files) that show in the comparison.</li>

<li>Next merge your new branch and merge it into the master branch by opening a Pull Request.  You have to name it and describe it.</li>

<li>Now click Merge Pull Request.  This will update your own master version of the Lab00 files.</li>

<li>Use the <tt>@mention</tt> feature to notify us when you do this.  Our Git names are <tt>@?</tt> and <tt>@robinkhill</tt>.</li>

<li>Then approve the Pull Request. Your master branch should now be the same as your new branch with the additional text files.</li>
</ol>
<p>End of Lab 00</p>
